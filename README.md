# Basic Java Chess Game

This project is a basic-level implementation of a chess game using Java Swing and AWT libraries. The game follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure the code and functionalities.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Utilizes Java Swing and AWT for the game's graphical representation.
- **Chess Logic:** Implements fundamental chess rules such as piece movements, capturing, and check conditions.
- **OOP Structure:** Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming concepts for modular and organized code.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Allows two players to play against each other on the same screen.
- **Basic User Instructions:** Provides basic guidance on how to play the game.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start Screen:** Upon launching the game, a chessboard GUI will be displayed.
2. **Player Turn:** Players take turns to move their pieces by clicking on a piece and selecting the desired destination.
3. **Valid Moves:** The game highlights valid moves for a selected piece.
4. **Check ** The game detects check conditions and notifies the players accordingly.


## Future Improvements

This basic-level chess game can be expanded and improved by adding the following features:

- Implementing an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Adding game modes (e.g., timed matches, special challenges).
- Enhancing the GUI with better graphics and animations.
- Providing additional documentation and comments for better code readability.

Feel free to contribute, modify, or enhance the game as needed!
